# 🌍 World Population Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Python

## 📌 Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global population dataset using Python libraries **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** in Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to uncover insights into population trends, country-wise distributions, and growth patterns across different regions and years.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 What This Project Does
- Loads and explores the world population dataset.
- Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
- Analyzes year-wise and continent-wise population growth trends.
- Identifies the top 10 most populous countries.
- Visualizes population distributions, growth patterns, and densities using:
  - Bar charts
  - Line charts
  - Heatmaps
  - Pie charts

## 📁 Files Included
- `data_exploratory.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full EDA code and visualizations.
- `world_population.csv` — The global population dataset.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Rapid population growth in Asia and Africa.
- Top 5 populous countries contributing to nearly half the world’s population.
- Year-on-year growth patterns visualized with line graphs and heatmaps.
